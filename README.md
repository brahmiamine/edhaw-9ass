⚡ Edhaw-9ass – Report Electricity Outages

This project is part of the #DoSomethingForYourCountry initiative.
It is free, open-source, and created with the purpose of building tools that solve real problems in our country.

🌍 About the Initiative

#DoSomethingForYourCountry is an open environment where developers can collaborate to create impactful tools for their communities. The belief is simple:
👉 If we don’t build these tools ourselves, nobody will.

🔌 Project: Edhaw-9ass

Edhaw-9ass is a reporting tool for electricity outages.

Users can report a power outage with a single button.
The tool automatically captures the user’s current address.
All reports are displayed in a table and chart, making it easy to track the number of shutdowns across regions.
This creates a simple but effective way for citizens to highlight recurring electricity issues.
